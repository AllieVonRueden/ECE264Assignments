
In this assignment, we will read a file full of integers, sort them,
and then search for particular values. You will do this by editing the
file "answer03.c". You should not edit any other files.

To pass this assignment, just fill in the blanks in answer03.c. The
comments in this file are there to guide you. You can (and should)
create extra functions as needed. Please take care to follow the
coding standards of the course. (For example, do not use any static
variables.)

Once you are happy with your solution, and it passes all of the
testcases, and everything is *neat* and *tiddy* in your source file,
and you compile without warnings, then please submit it to
blackboard. Only submit the file "answer03.c"

Good luck, and remember to use google and speak to your class-mates.
